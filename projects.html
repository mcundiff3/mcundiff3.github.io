        <h2>Solar Powered Water Pump - Team Lead</h2>
        <h3>About The Project</h3>
        <p>Our team worked to develop a solar powered water pump from design, construction and maintenance. This meant working the the La Mission Children's Fund, a non-profit which works to provide aide to children in and around Baja, Mexico. More information on the partnership can be found <a href='https://www.lamisionchildrensfund.org/clean-water-sustainable-energy/', target="_blank">here</a></p>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>Beginning as a volunteer I was elected subteam leader and then team leader in my second year on the project. This meant I worked to connect stakeholders at LMCF, those on the ground in the locations we partnered with, our faculty advisor, potential donors and the team. It also meant leading meetings with all our ~20 engineers, organizing documentation and a poster session, and making sure each subgroup knew they're next steps and were working together.</p>
        <p>** The team is still continuing our work at new locations. See the application <a href="https://globalties.ucsd.edu/projects/Baja%20Solar%20Water%20Heater.html", target="_blank">here</a></p>
